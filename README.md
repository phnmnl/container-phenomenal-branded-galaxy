PhenoMeNal Galaxy with PhenoMeNal branded skin.

## Description
The PhenoMeNal Galaxy has reached a stage where proof-of-concept integration between VMIs and containers is operational, and where initial services make it possible to carry out pieces of analysis workflows within the Galaxy. This tool provision virtual infrastructures using contextualization tools (MANTL, Terraform, and Ansible) and demonstrated them to instantiate PhenoMeNal Galaxy on local hardware, private cloud installations, and public cloud providers.
